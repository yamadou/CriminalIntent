# CriminalIntent
This is the second and largest app in the book Android Programming 
Big Nerd Ranch Guide. 
Description(taken from the book): CriminalIntent lets you keep a record
of your colleagues'lapses around the office, you will learn to use
fragments, master-detail interfaces, list-backed interfaces, menus,
the camera, implicit intents and more. 
Note: I have skipped the camera part of the project.
